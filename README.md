The port was based on the RSDKv4 (like s1f and s2a is) but remember, this port is not official or uploaded by team forever

# How can i download the port?

To download the port and its stuff click [there](https://www.mediafire.com/file/7100kclpjw0v6sc/S2A.zip/file) then extract the file and install the port, then go to "RSDK/s2a" and place the files in it!
